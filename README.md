# Credit-Risk-Default-Analysis:Root Cause Insights Using Python
# Overview
This project focuses on Credit Risk Default Analysis, leveraging real-world inspired 
lending data to investigate the root causes of customer defaults. In lending institution, 
defaults directly impact profitability and long-term sustainability, making it critical to identify which customer characteristics,
products,or behaviors are most strongly linked to default risk.
# Introduction
In todayâ€™s financial industry, lending institutions face one of their greatest challenges: managing the risk of loan defaults.
When customers fail to repay their loans, organizations not only lose revenue but also suffer from operational inefficiencies and strained resources.
To remain competitive, businesses must go beyond tracking numbers  they need to uncover why defaults happen, who is driving them, and what patterns exist beneath the surface.
The dataset contains customer credit scores, loan product types, branch performance, officer assignments, repayment behavior,
and financial losses. By analyzing these variables, we can ascertain the financial institution risk exposure and pinpoint the key drivers of default.
The goal of this project is not only to measure performance but also to conduct a **root-cause analysis of loan defaults** using statistical tests, visualization,
and anomaly detection. This provides a foundation for actionable insights helping decision-makers strengthen credit policies, optimize product offerings,
and improve portfolio risk management.
